#UI localization for config tool.

= Introduction =

Many friends are interested in translate the config tool into their own language, and I really appreciate their willing to help. In this guide, I'll introduce how to translate the config tool step by step.

= What do I need =
 * Visual C# Express 2010. This one is completely free, you can download from [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-csharp-express here]. You can also use the commercial Visual Studio 2010 (are you that rich?). There are trial visions [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/try here]. 
 * A svn tool to download and upload files. I personally recommend TortoiseSVN. You can download it from [http://tortoisesvn.net/ here].
 * A Google Account for permission to upload the code. If you haven't have one, you can create a account [https://accounts.google.com/NewAccount here]. Drop me a e-mail (huangxiaojiang (at) pku.edu.cn) and I will add you to the committer group.

= Step 1. Checkout files using SVN =

1. Open the Windows Explorer, navigate to an directory. This will be the directory that stores the code file. In this example I'll use "D:\HazyOSD". Right Click on the directory, click on the "SVN Checkout..." Menu, as follows

2. Fill in repository's URL in the pop-up dialog, and click "OK"

3. Wait till all files are checked out, click "OK".

There will be two directories, i.e. "OSD" and "OSDConfig". The "OSD" directory contains the source files of the firmware, and the "OSDConfig" direcotry contains the source files of the config tool.
