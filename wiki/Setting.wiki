= ArduCAM OSD Config =

Thanks to Michael Oborne, we have now an incredible customization and the easiest setup of all ArduCAM OSD's resources.<br>
With ArduCAM OSD Config you can do all the job in just one place.<br>
Everything, from update firmware or charset to enable/disable and positioning panels.

You can download it from our [http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/downloads/list Download Section].

Are you looking for customization? So, Make you own layout by enabling or disabling from the panel list.
