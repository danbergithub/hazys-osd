= Uploading Firmware =

The basic Remzibi's OSD comes with a MegaLoad bootloader, which allows us to upload firmware through serial port. 

There are two tools you can use to upload the firmware, the MegaLoad.NET software, or the OSD config tool. 

-----

== Upload using MegaLoad ==
 # Connect your USB-to-TTL adapter (e.g. FTDI table) to your computer
 # Connect the TX, RX and GND wire to the OSD's serial port, leaving the Power unconnected. 
 # Open MegaLoad.NET software, select the proper CommPort and Speed (9600bps)
 # Open the OSD firmware file (.hex)
 # Connect the Power wire to the OSD. The MegaLoad software should upload the firmware now.
 # Wait till the firmware has been uploaded.

-----
== Upload using OSDConfig Tool ==

=== Upload firmware for the first time ===

 # Connect your USB-to-TTL adapter (e.g. FTDI table) to your computer
 # Connect the TX, RX and GND wire to the OSD's serial port, leaving the Power unconnected. 
 # Open OSDConfig tool, select the proper CommPort.
 # Open the OSD firmware file (.hex)
 # Connect the Power wire to the OSD. The OSDConfig tool should upload the firmware now.
 # Wait till the firmware has been uploaded.

=== Update firmware ===

If previous version of hazys-osd software has been uploaded, the OSDConfig tool can reboot the OSD itself.
 # Connect your USB-to-TTL adapter (e.g. FTDI table) to your computer
 # Connect the TX, RX, GND and Power wire to the OSD's serial port. 
 # Open OSDConfig tool, select the proper CommPort.
 # Open the OSD firmware file (.hex)
 # Wait till the firmware has been uploaded.
